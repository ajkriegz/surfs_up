# surfs_up
This analysis was performed using Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook, and SQLite.

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to compare temperature data between June and December in Oahu, Hawaii in order to determine the feasibility of keeping a surf and ice cream shop open year-round.

## Results

Refer to the following tables for analysis on the temperature differences between June and December.

* The average temperature in June only differs from the average temperature in December by about three degrees Fahrenheit. The median difference is four degrees Fahrenheit.

* The maximum temperature difference between June and December is only two degrees at 85 and 83, respectively.

* The minimum temperature in June is only 64 while in December the minimum temperature reaches 56.

## Summary

The recorded temperature seems to be fairly constant between June and December with some slightly lower temperatures in December. The lowest temperatures on record for both June and December are several standard deviations below the mean temperatures, and, indeed, below the first quartiles as well. While outside the norm, these temperatures are possible.

While temperature in Oahu is fairly constant, other climates may not enjoy such weather. Additional queries should be constructed based on information on the home countries of surfers to determine whether the main customer base will be native to Oahu or largely international, in which case, the number of visitors to Oahu by month will need to be analyzed to determine whether there is a specific "tourist season" and whether that season can profit enough to keep the shop open out of season.

In addition, additional info is needed on the ideal environment for surfing. If temperature is fairly consistent, what makes for better weather for surfing? Is every day a good day for surfing? Does humidity play a part? What affects wave size and frequency? These factors need to be accounted for.
